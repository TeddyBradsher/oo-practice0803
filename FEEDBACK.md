# Part One - Intro to OO
- Using correct attr’s for the specs described
- should be `@years = years` with the default in the arguments to initialize `years = 1` otherwise it doesn’t matter what a user creates a Doctor with, it will always save 1
- Follow the file structure! Each class should be in it’s own file, those should be inside of the app/models folder and then create a `console.rb` to test and a r`un.rb` to start building a CLI for practice
